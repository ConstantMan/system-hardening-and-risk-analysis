This lab analyzes a simulated cosmetics production company and applies full security planning using:

- ISO 27001-based risk modeling
- Asset classification and threat identification
- Security Cards methodology (UW)
- Impact assessment and control mapping (FMEA)
- Final security plan document with mitigation proposals
